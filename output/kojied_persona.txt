**FRUSTRATIONS**

*   Pain Points: Technical limitations hindering workflow integration on Vision Pro (latency, lack of dev tools), the current cost/value proposition of AVP if it can't fully replace existing  setups, changes in familiar social environments due to demographic shifts ("intern season" in NYC bar), challenges with plant care, inconsistencies in areas like sports officiating.
