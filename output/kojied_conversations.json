      "selftext": "Let’s say the WG is the current western civilization. \n\nThe birth of Western history is in the Middle East, specifically Iraq (Nippur). Which is why the west, led by the US, has been trying to cause instability, and destroy historical artifacts. That way, the true history of how the WG came to be won’t come into light. Like, archaeology is basically using artifacts discovered and interpreting it a certain way. The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined \"archaeology\" a word.\n\n(Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.)\n\nBack to the main topic, what I’m saying is that it’s pretty easy for the “1%” to control the “story of our world” through archeologists and historians. These have traditionally been an activity for the rich and remains that way. Like, who tries to become a historian unless they have trust funds?\n\nSo yeah, maybe the history we are told on a daily basis is pretty different from reality, and Oda is trying to tell us this message.\n\nWhat are pacifistas? They're our modern comparable to AI. They will be the ultimate, infinite, obedient, power between the celestial dragons (also known as the 1%) and us normal humans.\n\nSo who is our Nika? Who is our Joy Boy? are we too early to hear the drums of liberation, or do we actually all have our own drums of liberation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[tourism of 19th century](https://preview.redd.it/bt1oqgxker7c1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2530f2a3b52b37bfd7547cfe4cf61b5d9d52e7c7)"

Best sources right now are likely the apple demo projects and docs on their developer site.   \n\n\nI've been trying to put some videos out as I get up to speed myself that you can check out if you want here: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrHzS0dchZzQ6G75qcNzBBqxzuE2xFJcQ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrHzS0dchZzQ6G75qcNzBBqxzuE2xFJcQ) Planning on making more as I continue getting familiar with things, so if there's anything specifically you're looking for more info on just let me know.

I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it’s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much…\n\nAlso where’s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a “work device”, they gotta have at least Xcode right?\n\nI can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can’t replace my entire workflow, I don’t know if I can justify the price. I’m sure it’ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you’d like to see ASAP."

After that I asked myself why I was doing that to myself. Can't really explain why. I think it's because I like to look at non-tech stuff (ie: gazing through the window) between two builds or two commits. There's also some cognitive dissonance between coding using vim/terminal (a 70s kind of UI) in a AVP.\n\nIf they have a native version of Xcode maybe my opinion will change, or maybe it's just my brain that needs adjusting, but so far the \"manager\" part of my workflow will move to the AVP, the \"engineer\" part of the workflow stays on my 2D screen",

With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next \"Pokemon Go\" that would propel their franchise to the next level.\n\nBeing Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.\n\n*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*\n\nI'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.\n\n[personal info redacted for obvious reasons](https://preview.redd.it/be7qbqfg5qgc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=21fec81575a29fa53fc01639e368980dc4c5ac6f)"

Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.\n I was at the wrong party. \n\nAs I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.\n Naturally I felt violated\n\nBut then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. \nNew York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city."

Greg Heffley is a zillennial with a millennial older brother and a younger Gen Z brother and he has to navigate the challenges of being the middle sibling. I remember watching Rodrick Rules the night before my first day of eighth grade and it was the perfect choice for that night at that point of my life. 10 years later I look up the actor who played Greg and he was born 2 months before me.
